# Django_Project
##--Dynamic content for a Dummy Travel Website---#
'''
#-Unzip to see the code-##

#-Code has been written using ORM and MVT models,to create a form through which 
  we can add Name, Destination, Price, Description and image for a dummy travel website.

#-And same would be visible on web when we run local server i.e. python manage.py runserver.
#=Any number of data can be added using the code and will be updated in database.

#-To run the code, here postgres migration is used for database connection and same is
  configured in the SQL connection. So migration should be done to run code, else it will error out.

# Django is awesome.

# Django unzipped and added.
